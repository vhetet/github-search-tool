# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to run this app

In the project directory, run:

* `npm i` to install the dependencies
* `npm start` to run this app in dev mode. It can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (make sure to have the port 3000 available or run it on another port)

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


## Potential improvements

* unit test, I decided not to unit test this app. I believe unit test to be very importan but there is litle logic in this app. I'm not planning to work more than I already did, and thus I'm worried about breaking an existing feature. Finally I am working alone on this app. For all this reason I did not feel like it was useful to add unit tests. 
* better styling. For example by importing a UI library. But in order to keep this app as light as possible I decided against it for this exercise.
* more search/filter options. As of now the app search for user and sort by stars. It would be very nice to offer more options in the search (search by other criteria or even conbine criterias), and offer sorting options.
* loading spinner.
* replace CSS by SCSS, I've done very little styling so CSS was fine but it would allow much better organization of the CSS code. Alternatively I could use styled component. 
* I consider this a POC, the next steps would be to do some user testing and use the feedback to decide what feature to implement next
